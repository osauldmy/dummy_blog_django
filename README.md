# About

Dummy blog. An assignment for me as a job candidate.

Django was chosen because of need to administrate blog posts. Has very simple frontend in bootstrap.

Allows CRUD for blog posts from django admin, has read-only FE and tiny read-only API with an option for filtering using tags.

Firstly create `.env` file from `.env.sample`, then run using docker-compose and proceed to `localhost:8000/admin` or `localhost:8000/posts`

```shell
$ docker-compose up app
```

**todo**: Replicate using FastAPI. Admin for FastAPI sounds particularly interesting.
